## Autodifferentiation
-------------------------
As discussed in this paper [Automatic Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05767.pdf), the technique of automatic differentiation could be of great benefit to Neural Net. In my free time, I try to come of with simple examples to show-case how simple and useful automatic differentiation is. I hope you will enjoy it too. This is just an example it is not meant to be used in production systems.
